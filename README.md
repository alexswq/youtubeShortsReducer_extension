## Why

I often use youtube and I find that the shorts feature on youtube are a big time vampire so I made this quick extension for all people who value their time and do not want to waste their productive time watching tik tok lite.

## What it does

It will delete the link to `Shorts` from youtube and will prevent you from scrolling mindlessly through the endless recommendations that youtube will shove down your throat by redirecting you to the homepage.

It WILL permit you to enjoy a shorts video if you click on it from your recommended vids. This is not a `kill all shorts` extension. It is just here to prevent the mindless scrolling that you can get sucked into.

## How to use

It is not on google extensions store yet but I'll try to get it on there
Until then you just need to go to Extensions in your browser of choice and add it manually with `Load unpacked`.
